# Privacy Policy – NovaJSON Prettifier

**Effective date:** 22 July 2025

NovaJSON Prettifier is a Chrome extension that formats raw JSON directly in your browser. We respect your privacy: the extension does not collect, transmit, sell, or store any personal or usage data.

## What the extension does
- Detects when a page returns JSON (`application/json` or `.json` URLs).
- Formats that JSON locally and adds UI controls (collapse/expand, search, etc.).
- No information leaves your device.

## Data collection & sharing
We **do not** collect, log, transmit, or share any data. All processing happens client-side within your browser tab.

## Permissions
The extension requests access only to pages that serve JSON so it can read and format that content. It does not access other sites or resources for any other purpose.

## Third-party services & remote code
No third-party analytics or remote code execution is used. All code ships with the extension package.
